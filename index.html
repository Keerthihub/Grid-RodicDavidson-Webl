            <h5><strong>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</strong></h5>
            <p>
              Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London
              since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we
              have developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often
              Listed and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and
              experience consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed Building
              Consents and Great Estate Licenses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many areas within central London boroughs were originally
              developed by aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor,
              Cadogan, De Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates
              still own large swathes of, what is now commonly referred to as,
              Prime Central London. These Great Estates maintain significant
              influence either through direct ownership or through various
              stewardship schemes, an example being the Belgrave Estate
              Management Scheme administered by Grosvenor. Schemes such as this
              enable the Estate to exert control over the use, development, and
              appearance of the designated area.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London
              and elsewhere in the UK. Through sensitive, contextual design and
              iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have
              established a track record of obtaining difficult planning
              consents for both new-build and existing properties.

            <h5><strong>Who are we?</strong></h5>
            <p>
              We are Rodić Davidson, an award-winning architecture, design, and
              interiors studio with the belief that buildings are more than
              brick and mortar; they are an extension of ourselves and our
              environment. Our practice specializes in design-led and highly
              crafted renovations and new-builds. We pride ourselves on an
              ability to deliver thoughtful and imaginative design whilst
              safeguarding our clients’ commercial interests.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are a RIBA Chartered Practice based in Bloomsbury, central
              London. Whilst much of our work is local to us in London, the
              practice has an expanding portfolio of work across the UK;
              predominantly in the east and southeast of England but also
              including projects reaching as far as Scotland. We have experience
              working in rural locations, particularly in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent
              and Sussex where we have undertaken a number of farmstead and
              country house projects, for both UK and overseas-based clients.
              These projects often involve sensitive restoration of listed
              buildings, usually with some more contemporary new-build
              additions. The practice seeks to develop sensitive yet ambitious
              design solutions that celebrate heritage while recognizing that
              buildings are often now required to perform different functions
              and should consume less carbon in doing so. In striving for lower
              carbon design solutions, we look to insulate well and integrate
              renewable technologies wherever possible
